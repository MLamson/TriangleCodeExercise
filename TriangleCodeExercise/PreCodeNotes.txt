Write a program that can tell you, given 3 lengths, if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
The program should raise an error if the triangle cannot exist.

Hint
The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the length of the third side, a principle known as the triangle inequality.
Example function signature in C#:
public string isTriangle(int side1, int side2, int side3)
Example input/output:

isTriangle(3, 3, 3) => “Equilateral”


Outputs:
Isosceles = 2 sides are equal
Equilateral = all sides equal
scalene = no sides equal
Not a triangle = any 2 sides must be longer than the remaining side

if side a + side b < side c OR side a + side c < side b OR side side b + side c < side a 

     output  “ is not a triangle"
 
if side a = side b and side b = side c
 
      output “Is Equilateral triangle"

Else if side a = side b OR side a = side c OR side b = side c

     output “is Isosceles triangle"

Else 

     output “is scalene triangle"
